# Crawler for addresses in a list of sites

### !!!***Be sure to have installed all the libraries used within this project before trying to run it on your own computer***!!!

## Challenge #1
Address Extraction

Write a program that extracts all the valid addresses that are found on a list of company websites. The format in which you will have to extract this data is the following: country, region, city, postcode, road, and road numbers. 

The list of companies is stored in the 
***websites.snappy.parquet*** file

Explore this from as many different angles as you can. It will generate valuable questions. We are also interested in your explanations, reasoning and decision-making along with the actual output. 

### Challenge #1 **Guidelines**

- Check whether the program correctly extracts the country, region, city, postcode, road, and road numbers from every page of every website.
- From a tech stack perspective, you can use any programming language, toolset or libraries you're comfortable with or find necessary, especially if you know it will be better or more interesting (we generally prefer Node, Python, Scala).
